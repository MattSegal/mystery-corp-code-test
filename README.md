# Mystery Corp Code Test

A powerful and shadowy organisation has requested a small front-end application to keep track of their favourite TV shows. You can view the implementation [here](https://mattsegal.github.io/mystery-corp-code-test/).

This application is essentially an interface for interacting with an API that is provided by [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Although the identity of our end-user is nebulous, their requirements are clear. As an end user, they would like to:

- Search for TV shows by name, so that they can find new content to watch
- Watch the trailer for each search result, so they can decide whether they will like it
- Add new movies to their watch list, so that they can watch them later
- Add movies to their favourites, so that they may trumpet their good taste to other intenet denizens
